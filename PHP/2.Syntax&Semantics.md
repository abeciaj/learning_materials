# Syntax & Semantics
This is the beginning of everything for PHP :) We will discuss the basic code syntax down to some of the core programming references.

## Language Constructs
Language constructs are hard coded into the PHP language. They do not play by normal rules.

Example of this are  `if`, `for`, `while`, `function`, and so on. Other examples for language constructs that could be mistaken for functions are `array()`, `list()` and `each()`.

## Code Block
A code block is a **list of statements grouped as one unit.**

```
<?php
echo "Hello World";
?>
```

## Comments
A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.

Syntax for single-line comments:
```
<?php
// This is a single-line comment

# This is also a single-line comment
?>
```
Syntax for multiple-line comments:
```
<?php
/*
This is a multiple-lines comment block
that spans over multiple
lines
*/
?>
```

## Data Types
Variables can store data of different types, and different data types can do different things.

PHP supports the following data types:

- String
- Integer
- Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
- Boolean
- Array
- Object
- NULL
- Resource
